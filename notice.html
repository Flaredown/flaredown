	<h1>Flaredown is offline, for now</h1>
	<p>I am very sorry to have to announce that Flaredown has been taken offline.</p>
	<p>This was not expected. A service provider that hosted Flaredown was phased out, but they offered an automated migration to a new platform and Flaredown has been migrated before with no issue.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, after migration the Flaredown app did not function on the new service. The developer who helped with the migration looked into the issue and determined that it would take significant funds to update the app to the point that they could even start troubleshooting.</p>
	<p>Flaredown is a free and open source app, and I have personally supported the development and maintenance of it for the past 6 years. I don't currently have the funds for a project of the magnitude required to get it back up and running.</p>
	<h2>What about the data?</h2>
	<p>First and foremost, I am looking into ways to extract data and send exports on request. The databases were backed up during migration, but user account data and health data are stored separately and joined by the app for security and privacy, making it a challenge to associate a user with their data without the running app. I am currently seeking developers to help with this effort.</p>
	<p>If you would like to receive an export of your data in the event that we are able to send exports, please use the form below.</p>
	<h2>What's next for Flaredown?</h2>
	<p>Flaredown is pretty old in app years. I assumed that many great alternatives had popped up in the meantime, but I was surprised to hear how many of you have not been able to find another tool that was able to track all the factors of chronic illness that we deal with every day.</p>
	<p>We need tools built by patients, for patients, and I believe a next generation Flaredown could be created and actively supported by the full community. If that sounds like something you'd like to be part of, please add yourself to the list below.</p>
	<h2>Get updates</h2>
