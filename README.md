Flaredown Static Site
---

Uses Github Pages to serve some static content. You should probably use Jekyll to preview.

TL;DR

- clone repo
- `bundle install`
- `bundle exec jekyll serve --port 4000`
- http://localhost:4000

Make some changes, and merge final results into branch `gh-pages` for production display.
